  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#   - family: Satoshi
#     fonts:
#       - asset: assets/fonts/satoshi/Satoshi-Light.otf
#         weight: 300
#       - asset: assets/fonts/satoshi/Satoshi-Regular.otf
#         weight: 400
#       - asset: assets/fonts/satoshi/Satoshi-Medium.otf
#         weight: 500
#       - asset: assets/fonts/satoshi/Satoshi-Bold.otf
#         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
